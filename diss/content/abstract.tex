\abstract{

  In the past couple of years the field of Reinforcement Learning has been
  shaken up by the re-popularisation of neural networks as general function
  approximators, allowing researchers to plug them in the reinforcement learning
  loop. The shift of part of the community to this particular methodology
  appears to have created the need for test-beds that are unusually more
  data-hungry, data-driven and related to vision or natural language processing.
  Moreover, the inherent hierarchy of those approximation techniques calls for
  advances in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. To satisfy these needs we
  have developed a platform for agent learning based on a classic
  Real-Time-Strategy (RTS) game, Starcraft Brood War, coupled with a general
  interface to the popular Lua tensor library Torch to be able to perform
  experiments based on recent algorithms. 
  
  To test the framework we have also ported the recent ``deep'' variant of
  Q-learning, DQN, and evaluated the platform on a few simple maps.
