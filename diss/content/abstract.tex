\abstract{

  In the past couple of years the field of Reinforcement Learning has been
  shaken up by the re-popularisation of neural networks as general function
  approximators, allowing researchers to plug them in the reinforcement learning
  loop. The shift of part of the community to this particular methodology
  appears to have created the need for test-beds with significantly different
  properties than the ones present in classical settings such as GridWorld and
  bandit problems.
  
  To satisfy these needs we have developed a platform for agent learning based
  on one of the most popular Real-Time-Strategy (RTS) game, Starcraft Brood War.
  Additionally we developed a general interface for the popular Lua tensor
  library Torch to be able to perform experiments based on recent deep
  reinforcement learning algorithms.
  
  Finally, to test the framework we have also ported the recent ``deep'' variant
  of Q-learning - DQN - and evaluated the platform on a few simple maps.
