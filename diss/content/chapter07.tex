\chapter{Conclusion}

This project had the goal to explore ways to transform \emph{StarCraft: Brood
  War} - a popular but relatively old Real-Time Strategy game - into a
fully-fledged machine learning and artificial intelligence research environment.

Designing, implementing and testing the platform took well over 800 hours, while
a couple of other hundreds of hours were spent reproducing different
implementations of Q-learning and Deep Q-networks. Unfortunately a lot of time
was spent refactoring and dealing with the complex - and sometimes buggy -
behaviour of Windows APIs and StarCraft, however our efforts paid off by giving
us an extensible and useful platform. We are truly looking forward to seeing
what work will be enabled in the future thanks to our project.

Finally reaching the end of this project, we can now say to have reached an
extremely satisfactory point with respect to the development of this agent
learning platform: not only we met and went past our initial engineering goals,
but we also managed to show that it is possible to learn interesting policies
using both standard Q-learning and Deep Q-learning when StarCraft is reduced to
a simple MDP setting. By doing this we laid down the algorithmic baseline for
our next experiments in the area.
