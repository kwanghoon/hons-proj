\chapter{Conclusion}

Designing, implementing and testing the platform took well over 800 hours, while
a couple of other hundreds of hours were spent reproducing different
implementations of Q-learning and Deep Q-networks. Unfortunately a lot of time
was spent refactoring and dealing with the complex - and sometimes buggy -
behaviour of Windows APIs and StarCraft, however our efforts paid off by giving
us an extensible and useful platform.
