  My first thanks go to Subramanian Ramamoorthy. The many years spent under his
  guidance, advice and interesting discussions played a vital role into making
  my time at Edinburgh a life-changing experience. He taught me what a great
  scientist looks like and showed me the path to become one. I hope one day I'll
  be able look at myself in the mirror and see someone as hardworking and
  academically principled as he is.

  Many thanks go to the members of the RAD group - Majd Hawasly, Svetlin Penkov,
  Stefano Albrecht, Stathis Vafeias, Benjamin Rosman, Daniel Angelov, Stavros
  Gerakaris Emmanuel Kahembwe, Pavlos Andreadis, and many others - for all the
  discussions on AI, machine learning, politics, food, life and everything else.
  I especially thank Alejandro Bordallo for being the best labmate one could
  ever wish for, and Sandy Enoch for being a fantastic friend and inspiring
  roboticist.

  I want to thank my classmates and friends for teaching me to truly enjoy my
  time, and for making the many thousands of hours spent in Appleton Tower and
  Forrest Hill a way more fun experience than I would have ever imagined
  possible. My degree would not have been nearly as enjoyable without you all.

  A huge amount of thanks go to Pushmeet Kohli, Matthew Johnson and all the folks
  at Microsoft Research Cambridge for providing me with the idea behind this
  project and the support to carry it out. I must also thank Tejas Kulkarni for
  giving me constant and useful feedback. 

  Finally the fullest gratitude goes to my mother, my father and my brother,
  whose unconditional support enabled me to enjoy those years as much as I
  humanly could. They are the best family one could wish for.
