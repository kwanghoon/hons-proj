\chapter{Introduction}

Artificial Intelligence is an extremely interesting but difficult problem to
address, as research has to at least account for the complexity and breath of
behaviour that has been shown in animals and humans. Autonomy can be sometimes
programmatically engineered, but most of intelligent behaviour requires some
amount of learning that can only be acquired through direct interaction with the
environment, as a big part of being ``intelligent'' has to do with the ability
to generalise knowledge and behave reasonably in unseen scenarios.

A technique developed specifically to address this type of learning process is
Reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning provides a general framework
to learn behaviour in a goal-oriented fashion and without requiring expert
knowledge or labelled data. It is framed to be functional even in situations
where reward is delayed and where environments are not deterministic. Because of
its foundations on dynamic programming, it also allows the use of rich and
powerful mathematical tools for its analysis.

\section{Approaching the problem} % TODO rename

The point of this work was primarily about exploring what it would take to
concretely transform and use StarCraft as a platform to study reinforcement
learning and general artificial intelligence. We adopted a scoping approach to
deal with the engineering problem, with the goal to reach a state where we could
successfully run state of the art learning algorithms on StarCraft. This
therefore required the construction of a robust and generic interface to the
game, the creation of an interface to one of the popular tensor libraries and
finally porting and testing a few basic reinforcement learning and deep
reinforcement learning algorithms.

The idea was to prove the feasibility of using StarCraft as a learning platform,
to release the first version of a useful interface to allow the community to
bootstrap work on real time strategy games, and to create a baseline for later
work in the area.

\section{Report Structure}

Chapter 2 presents reinforcement learning and discusses some of the research
done by games. It outlines properties of real time strategy games and it seeks
to explain the benefits of using StarCraft as a research platform. Chapter 3
presents the engineering approach taken and the developed architecture, covering
the entire pipeline from the game to the agent interface, also providing some
example agent learning algorithms.
