\title{StarCraft Brood War as an Agent Learning Platform - Interim Report}

\abstract{

  In the past couple of years the field of Reinforcement Learning has been
  shaken up by what is now labelled as Deep Reinforcement Learning, that is the
  process of using deep architectures such as convolutional neural networks to
  approximate some of the functions required in a reinforcement learning
  process. The shift of part of the community to this particular methodology
  appears to have created the need for test-beds that are unusually more
  data-hungry, data-driven and related to vision or natural language processing.
  Moreover, the inherent hierarchy of those approximation techniques calls for
  advances in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning. To satisfy these needs we
  have developed a platform for agent learning based on a classic
  Real-Time-Strategy (RTS) game, Starcraft Brood War, and we have built an
  interface to be able to perform experiments based on a popular Deep Learning
  framework, Torch. To test the framework we have then ported the recent
  ``deep'' variant of Q-learning, DQN and made it train on a few simple maps.
  Finally we have started developing an Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
  algorithm for primitives discovery.
